          <p>Friendly Fixtures was a responsive web application I chose to develop
          for my University dissertation. This application demanded the process of
          a professional project, including: project management, research, documentation,
          use cases, and testing, proving my ability to independently manage a project. Weekly meetings
          were undertaken to track progress, adopting a scrum methodology, recording what changes were
          made in the project and determining whether future changes were advisable. The base languages included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
           This controlled the visuals of the application and any dynamic elements such as
          the responsive mobile menu. The application was supported by a MySQL database backend hosted locally using XAMPP to run
          Apache & MySQL. The database would securely store user account information by hashing passwords with the BCRYPT function,
          when required they would be dehashed to log the user into the application.</p>

          <p>This project was achieved during my HND at New College Nottingham. The project was team based &
            required us to follow a professional project life cycle to produce all the required documents and
            software for completion. We were handed a client brief in which we had to provide a solution for a hotel
            still using a paper-based documentation system. I first assessed the team and assigned roles based on strengths, this
            ensured all team members were comfortable and efficient when producing documents. Weekly meetings
            were undertaken to discuss current tasks and progress and avoid the repeating of already completed processes.
            After thoroughly researching the task we began developing: communication plans, quality assurance plans, project contracts,
            & database designs. I then distributed work evenly on Visual Studio, assigning a section of the application to each team member
            which was coded in C#, with a combination of PHP & MySQL to support the datbase functionality.

          <p>A project completed during my HND: involved building a system from base components and installing software
            on the system including: anti-virus, programs, and diagnosing the system to check for any faults. This was
            completed in a small team in which we were constantly communicating to ensure that all problems were well
             recorded and solved effectively. This is something i also do in my spare time for friends and family. I have
             recieved numerous requests to build computers & repair hardware. This usually involves compiling a list of componenets which is
             sent to the client to ensure they are satisfied. I then proceed to order components, assemble the PC and install
             required & requested software. These machines are then shipped to the client in funcional working order.
             I have also guided a client across the country in their build over Skype, completing the build successfully.
             I also have experience fixing mobile phones, video game controllers, and anything i can get my hands on,
             its something i genuinely enjoy as i take pride in my problem solving skills. On numerous ocassions hard drive
           malfunctions were a key issue, i have diagnosed and repaired a number of drives, however, if they cannot be salvaged
            i restore the previous software and attempt to retain any files on the new drive that can be obtained.</p>
